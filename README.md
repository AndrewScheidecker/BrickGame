# Overview

This is a simple game, meant to demonstrate the BrickGrid plugin (https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/BrickGame/tree/master/Plugins/BrickGrid/Source/BrickGrid).

The BrickGrid plugin adds a component that imitates Minecraft's bricks. The bricks are cubes that may contain some material, arranged in a 3D grid.

Most of the functionality is implemented in plugins, so you can use those plugins from your own game project without modifying their source code.

# Engine modification

BrickGame is built with a slightly modified branch of Unreal Engine 4.14. The code for the branch is [here](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/tree/BrickGame). Note that it has the same permissions as Epic's UE4 GitHub repo, so that link will only work if you're signed into a GitHub account that is linked to your Epic UE4 account. To use this branch to link against BrickGame, clone it locally, and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/UnrealEngine/blob/BrickGame-4.11/README.md) to register the branch for use by the "Generate Visual Studio Projects" command.

The changes are:
* Light propagation volume is hacked to ignore the ambient occlusion values computed for the bricks, which will only apply to the ambient cubemap.
* The way the renderer determines which static elements of a primitive are drawn is modified to allow BrickGame to cull back faces for entire chunks before sending anything to the GPU. BrickGame will compile without this change, but it will not benefit from the early backface culling.
